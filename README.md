## Notes about the project
This project was more challenging that previously planned since its my first time using these technologies, so I spent a lot more hours that the ones indicated in the task, but I'm happy with the result since I learnt a lot in the process by trying, failing and invastigation by myself.

### Encountered problems
It was very difficult to adjust the size of some of the items and place them in the exact point I wanted. Some of the elements may differ from the Figma original design, but all of them as pretty simmilar.

The more challenging part was to use Flexbox and the images. Flexbox is a very versatile tool but it may be hard to adapt to it if its the first time using it. I found specially difficcult to include the images and adapt their sizes to the different sections and viceverssa.
